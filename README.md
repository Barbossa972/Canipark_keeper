# Canipark_keeper <br>
## Goal
The goal of the project is to develop a complete canipark keeper, which will be in charge of allowing the validated persons with their dogs in the canipark. <br>
The system will have the responsibility for managing subscriptions, generating temporary passwords, opening the door to whoever has the authorization.

The main points are:
<ul>
  <li>A code generator</li>
  <li>A priority ranking algorithm</li>
  <li>A UI to let people sign in and book a slot</li>
  <li>A database connected to the city hall services</li>
  <li>A dynamic password-receiving lock for the canipark door</li>
</ul>
